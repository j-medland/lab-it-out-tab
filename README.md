# Lab it Out Chords/Tab (Work in Progress)

This is the chords and tab for the Song "Lab it Out" by Mark Randel from his presentation at GDEVCon Europe 2024 in Stuttgart.

The lyrics are Mark's and the music/composition was from suno.com

Being AI generated, the audio is (in my opinion) muddled and has low-bitrate artifacts but I think these chords and tabs for the licks seem to work OK. I have been playing most of the chords as simple two-finger power chords.

If you hear something different or have other suggestions then contributions are welcome!

[Verse 1]
 F#5                 B5
Allocate, Don't Replicate
 F#5          C#5
Alleviate the logic gate
 F#5                  B5
Draw your fate, Don't conjugate
    D#5                 C#5 (or rest)    
Get LabVIEW before it's too late


[Chorus 1]
(You might want to slide into the F#5 chords from the 9th fret on the low-E string C# during the chorus)

      F#5               B5                      D#5        C#5
Times change, compilers change, methods change, LAB IT OUT
            F#5           B5                        D#5        C#5

[Bridge 1]
  F#5                    B5
Determine determinism, Just like an exorcism
      D#5                  C#5
Ain't no colloquialism Cut out the masochism
    F#5          B5             F#*
Get LabVIEW, Get past cynicism

           F#5            B5                D#5               C#5
Properties Change, people change, computers change LAB IT OUT
