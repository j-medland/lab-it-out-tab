\[Into\]


\[Verse 1\]

Allocate, Don't Replicate

Alleviate the logic gate

Draw your fate, Don't conjugate

Get LabVIEW before it's too late

\[Chorus\]

Times change, compilers change, methods change, LAB IT OUT

Properties change, people change, computers change, LAB IT OUT

LabVIEW

I can finally zoom, but don't wanna

\[Verse 2\]

Determine determinsim, just like an exoercism

aint no colloaqualism, cut out the mascochism

Get LabVIEW

Get past cynasimsm


\[Chrous\]

But Don't wanna change, compilers change, methods change LAB IT OUT

Properties Change, people change, computers change LAB IT OUT

LabVIEW

I can finally zoom but don't wanna!

I can finally zoom but don't wanna!

\[Verse 3\]
Determine determinism, just like an exorcism

Ain't no colloquiallism, Cut out the masochism

Get LabVIEW, get past cynicism

\[Chorus\]

But don't wanna change, compilers change, methods change LAB IT OUT

properties change, people change, computers change LAB IT OUT

LabVIEW, I can finally zoom but don't wanna!

I can finally zoom but don't wanna!

jitter jitter jitter gone.
